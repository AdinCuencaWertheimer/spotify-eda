## Goals and what I learned
- My goal was to explore EDA projects and to specifically explore the distribution of track popularity. I wanted to understand relationships between features and create visualizations to reveal hidden patterns for everyone to understand. I learned how to use tools such as Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. I also further extended my knowledge of Python.
